10x10 grid, obvious scquares dividing the game into the repsective 100 pieces.

Perimeter that's all black except for a one block "opening" that's white.

the non-winning pieces will be blue, the one winning piece will be red.

Any time that all red pieces are moved off of the "winning file" the player wins.
